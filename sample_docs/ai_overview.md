# Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

## Introduction to AI

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. It enables systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.

## Types of AI

### Narrow AI (Weak AI)
Narrow AI is designed to perform specific tasks within a limited context. Examples include:
- Image recognition systems
- Virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa)
- Recommendation engines

### General AI (Strong AI)
General AI refers to systems with human-like cognitive abilities. Currently, true general AI does not exist, but it remains a long-term goal of AI research.

## Machine Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without explicit programming. There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning
   - Uses labeled data for training
   - Examples: Classification, regression
   - Applications: Spam detection, image recognition

2. Unsupervised Learning
   - Works with unlabeled data
   - Examples: Clustering, dimensionality reduction
   - Applications: Customer segmentation, anomaly detection

3. Reinforcement Learning
   - Learns through trial and error
   - Uses rewards and penalties
   - Applications: Game AI, robotics

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning is a specialized form of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers. Key characteristics:
- Requires large amounts of data
- Automatically learns feature representation
- Excels at complex pattern recognition

### Applications of Deep Learning
- Computer Vision
- Natural Language Processing
- Speech Recognition
- Autonomous Vehicles
